# A Retreat Plan

**Important**: Do not consider this document as a guide for your activities. Please always consult wit a more qualified guide. This document contain a plan that I am planning to follow for the first time during my holydays.

A retreat is a period of time in wich your main activity will be the practice of spiritual activities. A retreat plan is a guide to develop you retreat<sup>1</sup>.

Usually a retreat consist in at least 3 days of spiritual practice, but it can be longer. [Lamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lama) have completed a traditional 3-years retreat, but it is known of cases of 10-years retreat, and even more<sup>2</sup>.

It is recommended to stop communication with the external world. This include watching news, talking to family and friends, and meeting other people<sup>3</sup>.

## A normal day in a retreat.
During a day in your retreat, you can have between three and four practice sessions. It is important to make pauses between them, specially if you are new in this kind of practices.
